An online implementation of the board game Mr Jack (http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Jack_(jeu_de_soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9))

This project is an attempt to create an online version of the board game "Mr Jack" by "EDITOR NAME NEEDED".

A version is already available online "LINK NEEDED HERE", but I didn't find it good enough. Or at least, it didn't reflect the awesomeness of the board game.

Here is a link if you to buy the game : .
